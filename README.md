This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About the Project
This is a site I created to show off my projects and allow people to learn a little bit about myself. It was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and Next.js.

The deployment of this website can be found at alexthomasweb.com or alex-thomas-react-with-next-portfolio.vercel.app

## Running the Website on your local computer

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
